Tools for scala developers.

    source /path/to/libscala.sh

If you're lucky, that's it.

    gh-commit <sha|svn> # accepts sha-1 or rev, shows in browser.  Completion on svn!
    java -XX:           # completes on java -XX: options
    scala -J-XX:        # also completes on -J-XX: options
    gco <tab>           # a git checkout which completes on local branches only
    gh-find Global      # open a browser to those files in trunk matching Global

There's a lot more in my stable, but I'm still trying to organize.
